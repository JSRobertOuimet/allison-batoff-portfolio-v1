## Description

The purpose of this project was to conceptualize and design a new customer portal. This project was undertaken to support a change in business direction from selling fixed contracts to a subscription payment model. This application was used by customers to track work, view reports and open tickets. The goal of this project was to create an experience that would be catered to the specific needs of different user groups, providing them with the level of information they needed in a just-in-time manner.

## Project Role

I was the sole user experience designer on an agile team of four developers and a product owner. I was responsible for determining the overall design direction of the project, while working with the product owner and the technical lead to ensure that the business needs were met and technical constraints were taken into consideration.

## Process

I began this project by researching competitor solutions to understand the expectations of our customers. I conducted one-on-one user interviews in order to build personas and worked with the product owner to gather requirements and write user stories.

Working from these requirements, I built process flow diagrams, wireframes and high-fidelity mockups. I used these deliverables to communicate with the development team and project stakeholders.

We worked in an iterative process to release weekly. This allowed me to A/B test and validate different solutions. As we were reaching our external release date, I designed and facilitated user acceptance testing.

## Solution

The user personas helped to illustrate three distinct types of users: buyers, handlers and contributors. Each of these users required different levels of granularity to the information presented to them in the portal. I solved this problem by creating different views based on roles in order to filter and prioritize relevant information and make the solution feel customized for each user.

    Clients often find the resourcing and projections too confusing, especially at the beginning of the month when a lot of work has been done and it looks like they are over-pace because the numbers are averaged - would be nice to have a more visual representation such as gauges and charts.

## Challenges

A key requirement for the buyer persona was to be able to consume data on their mobile device. While testing an early concept, I learned that the visualizations we were using were too detailed for this use case. This prompted me to simplify the visualizations and rethink how to best use the real estate we had available on mobile screens.
