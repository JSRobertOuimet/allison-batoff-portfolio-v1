## Description

The purpose of this project was to conceptualize and design a new SaaS product. This application was used to search a client’s repository of documents and facilitate the creation of RFPs using a machine learning algorithm. The goal of this project was to create an experience that would allow users to easily be able to curate their content and collaborate with team members.

## Project Role

I was the sole user experience designer working on this project. I worked closely with stakeholders and subject matter experts (SME). I was responsible for the overall design of the application as well as for helping to educate the team on user experience best practices.

## Process

I began this project by doing a domain analysis of the role and the environment of proposal writers. I used this to capture the tools that they use, the way they work, and how they collaborate with other members of their team. This allowed me to build personas for our two, key user types and to document our user stories as well as our key usage scenarios. I also documented the goals and requirements of the MVP as well as what features were on the roadmap for future implementation.

I used these requirements to build a set of wireframes and tested them with the SMEs. Based on their feedback and the results of testing, I produced high fidelity mockups and a set of design specs for implementation.

## Challenges

We explored several design concepts for the main segment view. We discarded a concept where segments were viewed full-screen within their parent document. This view took users out of context and caused friction as users needed to remember where they left off when they returned to their original task.

## Solution

During usability testing, we observed that while users searched the database of documents and found segments they wanted to use, they would often pass by an item and then have a difficult time locating it again. To solve this problem, we created a history feature that would allow users to see a timeline of items they had previously viewed.
