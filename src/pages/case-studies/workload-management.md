## Description

This project was driven by a new policy requirement to recover the costs of delivering government services. This was a significant change for the program as it required charging for a service that had previously been provided free of cost. These new fees also included strict service standards and required daily activities to be tracked at a very granular level. A large portion of the process that was previously paper-based also required a redesign in order to comply with digital transformation mandates.

This program processes approximately three thousand service requests a year. The goal of this project was to redesign the service to support the new requirements. We also aimed to replace some of the manual processes with automation as these tasks are very time consuming and result in manual errors.

## Project Role

I was the lead user experience designer working as a mentor to a student designer. We were on an agile team of four developers, a scrum master, a change manager, and a product owner. I was responsible for determining the overall design direction of the project, while working with the product owner and the technical advisor to ensure that the business needs were met and technical constraints were taken into consideration.

## Process

We began the process by doing business requirements gathering. This involved conducting sessions with subject matter experts on cost recovery, but also business reporting, legal, and finance to understand the data required by these different groups. We also worked closely with the security team to understand the sensitivity of the information we were going to be collecting and storing.

We captured these findings in the form of use cases as well as in visualizations in order to communicate and validate our findings with key project stakeholders.

While we were working to learn and record the business requirements, we were also conducting research to understand the user needs. We held job shadowing sessions with individual administration team members to see their day-to-day workflow. We also conducted individual user interviews as well as focus groups to better understand their pain points.

This allowed us to create a comprehensive journey map. The journey map illustrates the complexity of the current experience, tools involved, and pain points. We used this resource to guide conversations with our project team, users and stakeholders and to be able to point to exactly which issues we are aiming to address.

## Challenges

Unfortunately, because of the security approvals process, we were held up in development for long periods of time and could not release frequently. This limited our ability to do agile, iterative design. We were required to work ahead of development and do discovery, research, design, and validation phases as opposed to doing short cycles on specific increments of work. We did our best to gather feedback using prototypes, but we were unable to see how the application performed in a real work environment for several months.

## Solution

The business requirements gathering and user research allowed us to write user stories and plan our backlog. We did this visually through user story mapping. From this visualization, we defined an MVP release to validate our assumptions. We designed a prototype of a workload management solution to import and display service requests. This read-only MVP helped us to collect feedback and refine the solution before adding more complex business logic.

## Metrics

The digital certificate component of this MVP, which was launched in 2023, was able to achieve an 85% reduction in time spent by administrators over the previous paper process.
