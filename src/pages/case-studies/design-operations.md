## Description

User experience as a discipline is relatively new in Government of Canada information technology (IT) organizations. I joined an organization where there were some user experience designers and researchers on staff, however there was not a good understanding of the role among all teams and project stakeholders. This created challenges for team leads and managers to properly support these staff members. Project stakeholders often had never worked with a researcher before and did not understand the value that research can bring to their projects. This was creating friction and frustration.

These designers were often on tight deadlines with their project work. It was not an efficient use of their time to come into an organization and also educate their team and stakeholders on why they were there and why their role was important. We also recognized that these designers were often reinventing the wheel because we lacked UX best practices and standards of quality across the organization. Everyone worked in their own way and were not sharing resources.

This initiative was created out of a need to scale user experience practices and grow organizational user experience maturity.

## Project Role

I am one of two researchers working on a user experience enablement team. I share responsibility for the overall vision and strategy of design operations in our organization.

## Process

We began by gathering feedback and input from our different audiences. We conducted user research with the 12 researchers and designers in the organization. We used a quantitative survey and qualitative one-on-one interviews. Our research goals were:

Understand the scope of the user experience role across different teams in the organization.

Identify pain points that are impacting designers, teams, and projects.

Determine what support and resources user experience designers need to be successful on their projects.

Establish a baseline of overall job satisfaction.

We analyzed these findings for patterns and identified seven key pain points. We conducted a workshop with the design community to prioritize these pain points and to brainstorm actions we could take to help resolve these issues.

We also met with management to discuss their objectives. We worked with them to identify ways the UX community could support their vision for organizational growth and maturity.

We used these inputs to define a now-next-later roadmap. We set increments of 3 months to get feedback and adjust direction since the organizational landscape and priorities are frequently changing.

## Challenges

We have experienced several challenges since forming this team. For example, many of the designers working on staff are consultants, which makes it difficult for us to keep knowledge in house. We are also limited in our ability to train these staff members so we are often reliant on their openness and flexibility to learn new things on their own time. Our goal is to hire UX research and design employees, however attracting talent is difficult as we cannot compete with the salaries of private sector IT companies. Due to these challenges, one of the key priorities on our upcoming roadmap is staffing.

## Solutions

### Community

Our first priority was to establish a design community in our organization. Our aim was to create an environment where people would feel comfortable collaborating, sharing, and learning. We set up communication channels and a bi-weekly meetup for designers to connect with their peers. We have different templates for these meetings including demos and knowledge shares, design critiques, collaborative learning, and lean coffee.

We have received positive feedback that having this community has helped to reduce feelings of isolation and also allowed junior designers and students to learn through exposure to more experienced designers and researchers.

### Design System

The second initiative on our roadmap was to introduce a design system. This aligned with key management priorities of improving product delivery speed and increasing consistency across products. We believed this would also help address some of the pain points designers were experiencing, including:

- Duplication of effort across teams​;
- Adding unnecessary time to the design process​; and
- Challenges onboarding new designers​.

Based on input, we defined the scope of an MVP and introduced this to the design community in the winter of 2023/2024. Some teams are adopting the design system and we are beginning to measure the level of effort required for teams to onboard​ and how this impacts the time required for solution design and development​.

We are adapting the design system based on feedback to address any gaps and ensure the resources are clear and easy to understand by all roles in the organization. Our goal is to mature our design system to a place where it reduces strain on teams to focus on larger, more complex problems.

### Accessibility

Creating applications and experiences that are accessible for all users is a key tenant of the Government of Canada digital standards. With the introduction of the Accessible Canada Act in 2019 there has been a renewed focus on accessibility in our organization.

Addressing the accessibility problems of our portfolio is a large undertaking, so we broke this down into smaller increments of work. We began with an initiative to improve accessibility literacy in the organization. We started by ensuring that every component and pattern in our design system included guidelines on accessible use and implementation. We then built a knowledge base that includes training, recommended conferences and webinars, checklists, testing tools, online resources, and articles on getting started. Finally, we ran workshops and collaborative learning sessions both with the design community and with our product teams.

In the current phase of this project, we are procuring automated accessibility testing software for one product team. This team will pilot test the software and we will measure whether having these tools results in a better quality, more accessible product for the end users.

### Staffing

The upcoming priority on our roadmap is to address issues with recruitment and retention. We will be looking at creating partnerships with universities, improving the onboarding experience, defining a clear career path, and exploring ways we can make our organization a fulfilling place to work.
