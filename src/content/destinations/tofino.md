images:
    - alt: "Chesterman Beach in Tofino, Canada on a bright, sunny day. The sky is a pale blue with no clouds. In the foreground is a mound of grey rocks, some of which are covered in seaweed and salt. In the background is a small sliver of white sand beach and the Pacific Ocean. Silhouettes of rocky outcrops with some trees are a short distance offshore."

    - alt: "The forest on Meares Island in Tofino, Canada. In the middle of the image is a large tree that is leaning to the right side. The foliage is thick and green around the tree and not much of the sky is visible. Some daylight is shining down from above. In the foreground is a small section of the boardwalk."
