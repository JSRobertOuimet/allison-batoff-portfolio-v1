    - alt: "The skyline of Vancouver, British Columbia as seen from a boat in the harbour. The sky is blue with wisps of white clouds. The mountains are a dark navy blue in the background and appear in silhouette. High-rise condos and apartment buildings are lined up along the harbour front."

    - alt: "The sun is setting in English Bay, Vancouver and there are some wisps of clouds in the sky. The sky is a mix of yellows, oranges and blues. The water is full of small waves and reflects the colours of the sky. Sailboats are anchored in the foreground and cargo ships can be seen further out. The ships are in silhouette against the setting sun."
