    - alt: "Inside the Sagrada Familia. The image was taken from the nave of the basilica pointing up at the vaulted ceiling. The nave is flanked by two rows of columns that resemble tree trunks and branches climbing toward the sky. There are many points of light and shadow as the sunlight streams in through the windows."

The statues, including Joseph and the Virgin Mary are facing towards Jesus in the middle. At the bottom of the image is a panel with colourful green leaves, white and pink flowers, birds and nests that climb up the glass."
